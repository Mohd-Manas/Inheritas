      <p>
        Many people delay creating a Will, assuming it’s only necessary later in
        life. However, in the UAE’s legal context, having a Will is an urgent
        and essential step for anyone with assets, dependents, or business
        interests here.

        <li>
          <strong>Ensures Asset Distribution According to Your Wishes</strong>
          <br />
          Your Will clearly outlines who inherits what, avoiding confusion and
          unintended allocation of assets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prevents Family Disputes</strong>
          <br />
          In the absence of clear instructions, disagreements can arise among
          beneficiaries, causing unnecessary stress and strain on relationships.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoids Government Intervention</strong>

          Without a Will, courts follow Sharia distribution rules, which may not
          reflect your intentions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secures Guardianship for Your Children</strong>
          <br />
          You can appoint legal guardians, ensuring your children are cared for
          by someone you trust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Streamlines Wealth Transfer</strong>
          <br />
          A registered Will speeds up the legal process, allowing your
          beneficiaries to access funds and assets without prolonged delays.
