      <p>Sharia inheritance principles differ significantly from Western inheritance laws. These rules are applied automatically if a person dies without a Will, regardless of religion or nationality.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All bank accounts and assets are immediately frozen</li>
        <li>All transactions are halted until the court determines asset distribution</li>
        <li>Custody of children may not automatically go to the mother; courts will decide in accordance with Sharia principles</li>
        <li>Business and property ownership may be split in a way that impacts operations or intended succession plans</li>
      </ul>
