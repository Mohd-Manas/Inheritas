            <p>
              Inheritance in the United Arab Emirates is governed by a unique blend of UAE Federal Laws,
              local emirate regulations, and Sharia principles. While the UAE is home to a large expatriate
              population, its legal system applies Sharia principles to inheritance cases by default,
              regardless of the deceased's nationality or religion â€” unless there is a registered Will in place.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that without proper planning, your assets may not be distributed according to your
              personal wishes, and your family could face legal complexities and delays during an already
              difficult time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a legally prepared and registered Will or estate plan ensures your wishes are respected
              and your family is spared unnecessary emotional and legal burden. Careful estate planning helps
              safeguard your legacy for future generations and provides clear guidance to executors and beneficiaries.
