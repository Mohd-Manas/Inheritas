            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Inheritance in the United Arab Emirates is governed by a unique blend of UAE Federal Laws, local emirate regulations, and Sharia principles. While the UAE is home to a large expatriate population, its legal system applies Sharia principles to inheritance cases by default, regardless of the deceased’s nationality or religion — unless there is a registered Will in place.</p>
            <p>This means that without proper planning, your assets may not be distributed according to your personal wishes, and your family could face legal complexities and delays during an already difficult time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your estate is managed according to your specific instructions</li>
                <li>Your loved ones are financially protected</li>
                <li>Potential disputes are minimized</li>
                <li>Your children’s guardianship is decided by you, not the court</li>
            </ul>
